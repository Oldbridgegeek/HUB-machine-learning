# HUB-machine-learning
 HUB (Heidelberg Unseminars in Bioinformatics) about machine learning  
 
This repository contains example notebooks/workflows for [HUB](http://www.hub-hub.de/) machine learning event.  

### KNIME workflows
In order to use KNIME workflows you just need to install [KNIME analytics platform](https://www.knime.org/downloads/overview) (no additional KNIME packages are needed).

### Jupyter notebooks
In order to use jupyter notebooks you need Python 3.x with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and seaborn. All except seaborn are included in the default [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installation.
